Task 0: Positive anything is better than negative nothing

Write a Python program that assigns a random signed number to a variable `number` each time it is executed. Then print whether the number stored in the variable is positive, negative, or zero.

Task 1: The last digit

Write a Python program that assigns a random signed number to a variable `number` each time it is executed. Then print the last digit of the number stored in the variable along with a description whether it is greater than 5, less than 6 but not 0, or 0.

Task 2: I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

Write a Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, without a new line, using only one print function with string format and one loop.

Task 3: When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

Write a Python program that prints the ASCII alphabet in lowercase, excluding the letters 'q' and 'e', without a new line, using only one print function with string format and one loop.

Task 4: Hexadecimal printing

Write a Python program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in both decimal and hexadecimal format, separated by ' = '.

Task 5: 00...99

Write a Python program that prints numbers from 0 to 99 separated by ', ', with two digits for each number, and ending with a new line, using only two print functions with string format and one loop.

Task 6: Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need

Write a Python program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits, separated by ', ', with two digits for each combination, and ending with a new line.

Task 7: islower

Write a function in Python that checks if a given character is lowercase, without using the built-in functions `str.upper()` or `str.isupper()`, and without importing any module.

Task 8: To uppercase

Write a function in Python that prints a given string in uppercase followed by a new line, without using the built-in functions `str.upper()` or `str.isupper()`, and without importing any module.

Task 9: There are only 3 colors, 10 digits, and 7 notes; it's what we do with them that's important

Write a function in Python that prints the last digit of a given number, without importing any module.

Task 10: a + b

Write a function in Python that adds two integers and returns the result, without importing any module.

Task 11: a ^ b

Write a function in Python that computes a to the power of b and returns the result, without importing any module.

Task 12: Fizz Buzz

Write a function in Python that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz", separated by spaces, without importing any module.

Task 13: Insert in sorted linked list

Write a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list. The function should return the address of the new node, or NULL if it fails.
