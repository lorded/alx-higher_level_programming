Certainly! Here's a brief description of each task:

    Task 1: Hello World
        Description: This task is a simple introduction to programming. It usually involves writing a program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It's a common starting point for beginners to get familiar with the basic syntax of a programming language.

    Task 2: Variables and Data Types
        Description: This task focuses on understanding variables and data types in a programming language. Participants typically need to declare variables, assign values to them, and perform basic operations like addition or concatenation.

    Task 3: Control Flow (if statements)
        Description: In this task, participants work with conditional statements (usually if statements). They might be required to write a program that makes decisions based on certain conditions.

    Task 4: Loops (for or while)
        Description: This task involves working with loops, either for or while loops. Participants might be asked to write a program that repeats a certain block of code multiple times based on a condition.

    Task 5: Functions
        Description: Participants will likely be asked to define functions, pass arguments, and return values. This task is designed to test their understanding of how to structure and use functions in a programming language.

    Task 6: Data Structures (e.g., Lists/Arrays)
        Description: This task involves working with data structures like lists or arrays. Participants might be required to perform operations like adding or removing elements, accessing specific elements, or iterating through the data structure.

    Task 7: String Manipulation
        Description: Participants will work with strings, performing tasks like concatenation, splitting, or extracting substrings. This task assesses their understanding of string manipulation functions.

    Task 8: Error Handling
        Description: This task focuses on dealing with errors in a program. Participants might be asked to write code that handles specific types of errors gracefully, using constructs like try-catch blocks.

    Task 9: File Handling
        Description: This task involves working with files. Participants might be required to read from or write to a file, perform operations on the file's content, or handle file-related exceptions.

    Task 10: Advanced Concepts (optional)
        Description: This task could cover more advanced programming concepts, depending on the level of difficulty. It might include topics like recursion, object-oriented programming, or other language-specific advanced features.
